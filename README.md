## Web Application Summary
Clara (a skincare tracker app) is meant to help users learn about their skin, and take care of their skin, all based on normal, everyday trends and history that could be affecting their skin. This web application allows users to determine trends and patterns in where they break out, what kind of breakouts are occurring, and learn how to mitigate their breakouts based on these trends. To achieve this, we will implement a daily skincare tracker that allows users to log their breakouts daily by noting the location of the acne, severity/type of acne, and other descriptive features. There will also be a feature that will allow users to log and track the history of their skincare routine (both daytime and nighttime routines). A dashboard is also available for users in order to further observe their skin health trends such as acne type, breakout location, breakout frequencies, and breakout triggers.
